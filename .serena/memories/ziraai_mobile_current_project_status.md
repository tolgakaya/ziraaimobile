# ZiraAI Mobile - Current Project Status

## Project Overview
Enterprise-grade agricultural technology platform with AI-powered plant analysis and comprehensive mobile application.

## Project Structure
**Root Directory**: `C:\Users\Asus\Documents\Visual Studio 2022\ZiraaiMobile\ziraai_mobile`
**Critical Note**: All mobile development work occurs in `ziraai_mobile/` subfolder

## Current Development Status

### ✅ Completed Features
1. **Analysis Detail Screen** - Fully implemented with comprehensive data display
   - All 10 sections implemented (Plant ID, Health, Nutrients, Pests, etc.)
   - Complete API integration with safe type conversion
   - Turkish localization throughout
   - Visual nutrient grid (14 nutrients)
   - Disease/pest cards with confidence indicators
   - Farmer-friendly summary at top

2. **Data Models** - Complete and robust
   - `analysis_summary.dart` - Fixed type casting issues
   - `plant_identification.dart` - Added missing fields
   - `comprehensive_analysis_response.dart` - All 10 sections mapped
   - Safe null handling throughout all models

### 🏗️ Architecture Pattern
- **Clean Architecture**: Data/Domain/Presentation layers
- **BLoC Pattern**: State management
- **Dependency Injection**: GetIt service locator
- **API Integration**: Dio HTTP client with JWT authentication
- **Build System**: build_runner for code generation

### 🔧 Technical Configuration
- **Flutter Version**: Current stable
- **Dependencies**: All current, some packages have newer versions available
- **Build Status**: ✅ Successfully compiles and generates APK
- **Code Generation**: ✅ build_runner integration working

### 📱 Key API Endpoints Used
- `GET /api/v1/plantanalyses/list` - Analysis history for dashboard
- `GET /api/v1/plantanalyses/{id}` - Detailed analysis data
- `GET /api/v1/subscriptions/usage-status` - User subscription info
- **Authentication**: JWT Bearer token system

### 🌐 Localization
- **Primary**: Turkish (tr) - Agricultural terminology
- **Secondary**: English (en), Arabic (ar) support
- **Context**: Turkish agricultural market focus

### 🎯 Current Capabilities
- Complete plant analysis visualization
- Real-time API data integration
- Comprehensive error handling
- Safe type conversion for mixed API responses
- Responsive UI with Material Design
- Image loading with fallbacks
- Turkish agricultural terminology

## Development Workflow Established
1. **Pre-Development**: Always verify `ziraai_mobile/` directory
2. **Model Changes**: Update with safe type conversion patterns
3. **UI Development**: Comprehensive field display with fallbacks
4. **Testing**: Use `flutter analyze` for error detection
5. **Build**: Standard clean → pub get → build_runner → build apk

## Known Technical Patterns
- **Type Safety**: Use `?.toString()` for API mixed types
- **Null Safety**: Always provide meaningful fallbacks in Turkish
- **Error Recovery**: Keep backup files before major changes
- **API Integration**: Numeric ID for detail endpoints, not string analysisId

## Next Development Areas
- Additional screen implementations following established patterns
- Enhanced error handling and offline capabilities
- Performance optimizations for large datasets
- Extended API integration for full feature set

This mobile application is production-ready for plant analysis features with robust error handling and comprehensive data visualization capabilities.
